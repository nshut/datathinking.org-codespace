# Data Thinkers ♥️ Jupyter Notebooks in ♥️ GitHub Codespaces ♥️

Welcome to your shiny new codespace, data thinkers! We've got everything fired up and running for you to explore Python and Jupyter notebooks and all kinds of artificial intelligence technology such as Copilot and ChatGPT :)

You've got a blank canvas to work on from a git perspective as well. There's a single initial commit with what you're seeing right now - where you go from here is up to you!

Everything you do here is contained within this one codespace. There is no repository on GitHub yet. If and when you’re ready you can click "Publish Branch" and we’ll create your repository and push up your project. If you were just exploring then and have no further need for this code then you can simply delete your codespace and it's gone forever.

## Environment

The Anaconda environment is in `environment.yml` in the root of the repository. Select conda as the python interpreter within Visual Studio Code in the codespace to execute the code.
